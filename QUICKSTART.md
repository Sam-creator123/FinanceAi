## üîß BETTER WAY (Using a Local Server)

For the best experience, use a local web server:

### If You Have Python (Most Macs and Linux have it)

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
   - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type "cmd", press Enter
   - Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

2. **Navigate to Project Folder**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/insurance-fraud-detector
   ```
   
   Replace `path/to/insurance-fraud-detector` with your actual path.
   
   **Tip:** You can drag the folder into the terminal to auto-fill the path!

3. **Start Server**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   
   Or if that doesn't work:
   ```bash
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

4. **Open Browser**
   - Open your web browser
   - Type in address bar: `http://localhost:8000`
   - Press Enter

5. **Done!** The app is now running.

6. **To Stop Server**
   - Go back to Terminal/Command Prompt
   - Press `Ctrl + C`
